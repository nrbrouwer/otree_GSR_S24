        <p>
            In this game, you will be put into a group with {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP_minus_one }} other players.
            Each player will be assigned a color, either <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Blue</span> or
            <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span>. With a color assigned to each player, all players
            will then vote for one of the two colors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your winnings in this game depend on the coordination of your group. In order to receive points, <b>the entire
            group must vote for the same color </b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the vote is unanimous, your winnings depend on what color you were assigned at the beginning of the round.
            For example, if you were assigned <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span> and every player voted
            for <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span>, you would win <b>{{ C.payoff_agree_your_color }}</b>
            points. If you were assigned <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Blue</span>, but every player voted
            for <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span>, you would win <b>{{ C.payoff_agree_other_color }}</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>If the vote is not unanimous, <b>{{ C.payoff_disagree }}</b> points are awarded to all players.</u>
        </p>
        <p>
            You will play this game for {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} round.

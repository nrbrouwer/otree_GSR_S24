Added some basic CSS here to make the buttons for the color choices larger to avoid miss-clicks. However, the buttons
still aren't particularly pretty
-->
<style>
    .button {
        padding: 25px 25px;
        text-align: center;
        display: inline-block;
        font-size: 25px;
        color: white;
        font-weight: bold;
        margin: 0 25px;
        border: none;
        outline: none;
    }
    .button-blue {
        background-color: blue;
    }
    .button-red {
        background-color: red;
    }
</style>
<p>
    Your assigned color preference is
        {{ if player.prefer_blue }}
            <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Blue</span>
        {{ else }}
            <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span>
        {{ endif }}

copy+pasting code, but I couldn't get it to work for some reason.

        <p>
            In this game, you will be put into a group with {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP_minus_one }} other players.
            Each player will be assigned a color, either <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Blue</span> or
            <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span>. With a color assigned to each player, all players
            will then vote for one of the two colors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your winnings in this game depend on the coordination of your group. In order to receive points, <b>the entire
            group must vote for the same color </b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the vote is unanimous, your winnings depend on what color you were assigned at the beginning of the round.
            For example, if you were assigned <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span> and every player voted
            for <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span>, you would win <b>{{ C.payoff_agree_your_color }}</b>
            points. If you were assigned <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Blue</span>, but every player voted
            for <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span>, you would win <b>{{ C.payoff_agree_other_color }}</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>If the vote is not unanimous, <b>{{ C.payoff_disagree }}</b> points are awarded to all players.</u>
        </p>
        <p>
            You will play this game for {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} round.

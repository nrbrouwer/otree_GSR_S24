        <p>
            In this practice game, the computer will assign you a color at the beginning, either
            <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Blue</span> or <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span>.
            You will then be given the option to select either
            <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Blue</span> or <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span>
            for 10 rounds of this game. <b>The goal of this game is to select the color that matches the color you were assigned
            at the beginning of the game</b>. Your assigned color does not change between rounds. So, for example, if you were
            assigned the color <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span>, your assigned color would be
            <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span> in all 10 rounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            The challenge of this game is that <b>you will not be told what color you were assigned at the beginning</b>. Instead,
            at the beginning of each round, you will be given a <b>signal color</b> that indicates what your assigned color might
            be. There is a 66% chance that the signal color will match the color you were assigned. Likewise, the is a 33% chance
            that the signal color will be the opposite color.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you select the color you were assigned at the beginning, you will receive {{ correct_points }} points. When you
            select the color that does not match your assigned color, you will receive {{ incorrect_points }} points. You will
            not be told how many points you have earned in this practice game until you finish all 10 rounds.
